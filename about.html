            <p><strong>Welcome</strong> to my corner of the internet! My name is Nikole Goncalves aka the “HealthNut” behind HealthNut
                Nutrition. I live in Canada with my other half, Matt or as he's known on the internet “Mr.Matt” with our
                newly adopted pup Cashew! Six years ago while living and backpacking our way through Australia I decided
                to start one of the craziest things I've ever done… I started talking to a camera and sharing videos on
                YouTube to strangers around the world.</p>

            <p>I am a passionate “healthnut” and I love to inspire others to live an active, balanced, and healthy
                lifestyle by showing how easy and delicious it can be! Before I started HealthNut I was a
                coffee guzzling, sugar addict, stress case, workaholic. I would often skip breakfast or survive off of a
                large double double coffee and sugar infused blueberry muffin and by the
                afternoon I would feel so exhausted, anxious, and moody that I needed even more coffee and sugar to get
                me through the day. Not only was I starting to feel exhausted, but my anxiety was also at an all-time
                high. I knew that I needed to make a change.

            <pre>I slowly cut out caffeine and starting drinking green smoothies every morning. I have often been called
                the Queen of Green Smoothies, and it's a title I'm proud to claim!</pre>
            I slowly started transitioning over to a healthier lifestyle, focusing on adding more nutrient dense
            foods into my “diet”.I started HealthNut 6 years ago as a way to
            document my wellness journey and stay motivated along the way while inspiring and connecting with other
            like-minded people around the world. What I didn't realize is that it would grow into such an amazing
            worldwide community. I am proud to say that I left my 9-5 corporate marketing job in January 2017 and
            now inspiring healthy living through my online platform is my full-time job and I pinch myself every day
